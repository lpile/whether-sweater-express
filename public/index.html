  <h1>Whether-Sweater-Express</h1>
  <p>Welcome to Whether-Sweater-Express, a RESTful JSON API using Express framework. Designed to expose endpoints to display weather for different cities, create and login users, and find forecast for future road trip which to be consumed by a hypothetical front end. It consumes the Dark Sky API for gathering weather data, parses it and returns only what is expected in the project specifications. Location data is parsed from a user friendly city, address, or location by Google Cloud Service's Geocoding API into latitude and longitude.</p>
